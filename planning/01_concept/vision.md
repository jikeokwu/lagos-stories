# Vision and Concept

## Core Philosophy

Lagos Stories is a text-based AI-first simulation game set in a modern-day Lagos city. It aims to push the boundaries of emergent narrative and gameplay by drawing inspiration from the systemic depth of Dwarf Fortress and the life simulation of The Sims.

### Key Pillars

1.  **AI-First Design**: Game systems are built with AI at the core. AI acts as an ever-present game master, interpreting player intent and generating events dynamically.
2.  **Real-World Lagos Setting**: No fantasy or magic. The drama emerges from realistic urban life—crime, politics, economy, and relationships within a bustling African metropolis.
3.  **Total Player Agency**: Players can do anything plausible. The world reacts based on systemic rules. There are no fixed win conditions; players choose their own goals (e.g., political power, business empire, survival).
4.  **Privacy & Autonomy**: Strictly designed for local-only LLM inference. No cloud dependencies.
5.  **Deep Simulation (No Hand-holding)**: Like Dwarf Fortress, the game prioritizes depth and complexity over accessibility. The world is indifferent to the player; you must learn its systems to survive and thrive.

## High-Level Goals

- **AI-First Simulation**: LLMs drive intent interpretation, episode framing, role-filling, opposition, and narrative meaning.
- **Coherence under Freedom**: Allow novelty but bound it by ontology, capabilities, and costs.
- **Emergent Narrative**: Stories unfold through simulation rather than pre-written scripts.
- **Personal & Open**: A passion project designed for players who enjoy figuring things out. No commercial compromises on complexity.
