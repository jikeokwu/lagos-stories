# UI/UX & Presentation

## Core Interface

### Primary Interaction

- **Chat Box**: The main interface is a simple text chat box for natural language interaction with the game
- **Text-Based**: The primary medium is text to maximize expressiveness and AI compatibility
- **Visuals**: Optional isometric or 2D graphical representation. Diegetic UI elements (e.g., an in-game smartphone for news/messages)

## User Experience Goals

- **Information Density**: Present complex simulation data (relationships, economy) in detail. Do not hide complexity; give players the tools to analyze it (graphs, logs, history)
- **Feedback**: Clear "ripples" from actions—show the player how they changed the world
- **No Hand-holding**: Avoid intrusive tutorials or "quest markers." The player drives the experience

## Onboarding

**Reference Manual** approach instead of tutorials:

- Wiki-style documentation
- Players can reference systems, mechanics, and concepts at their own pace
- No forced tutorial sequences
- Learn by doing and consulting documentation when needed

## Data Visualization

### During Gameplay

- Information presented through narrative and diegetic elements
- Chronicles Mode provides query access to specific facts

### Chronicles Mode (Full Access)

- **Under-the-Hood Values**: Players can see raw simulation data
  - NPC personality sliders (ambition, compassion, etc.)
  - Political ideology values
  - Relationship values (affection, trust, attraction, respect)
  - Organization effective values
  - Threat levels, agency levels (for understanding, not manipulation)
- **Power User Tools**: Social graphs, timelines, entity relationships
- **Raw Data Export**: JSON export for external analysis

This allows players who want deep understanding to explore the simulation's mechanics while keeping gameplay immersive.
